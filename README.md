# Turbo Fabi - Line Follower

## Project Overview 🤖

Welcome to Turbo Fabi, a line follower project that utilizes PID control. Turbo Fabi is a robot designed to autonomously track and follow a predefined path marked by a visible line on the ground. This project is implemented using the Arduino Uno and motor drivers, with infrared (IR) sensors for line detection.
