## Project Overview ü§ñ

Welcome to Turbo Fabi, a line follower project that utilizes PID control. Turbo Fabi is a robot designed to autonomously track and follow a predefined path marked by a visible line on the ground. This project is implemented using the Arduino Uno and motor drivers, with infrared (IR) sensors for line detection.

## Components üõ†Ô∏è

Here's a list of components used in Turbo Fabi's construction:

- **Chassis**: Constructed from foamboard, providing a lightweight and customizable structure.
- **Arduino Uno**: The brain of Turbo Fabi, controlling its movements and interactions with sensors.
- **Mini Breadboard**: Used for easy prototyping and connecting electronic components on the robot.
- **L293D Motor Driver**: The L293D controls the small DC motors.
- **Wheels**: Two wheels attached to the motors, enabling Turbo Fabi to move along the track.
- **Small DC Motors with Gearbox**: Two motors with a gearbox for precise control and movement.
- **Ball Caster**: Positioned at the front of the robot to provide stability and smooth navigation.
- **IR Sensor (QTR-8A)**: An infrared sensor used for line detection, allowing Turbo Fabi to follow the track.
- **LiPo Battery (Kryptonium 2S1P 12V)**: A powerful and compact lithium-polymer battery, supplying energy to the motors and electronic components.
- **Wires**: Various wires to connect the components, ensuring proper communication and power distribution.

These carefully chosen components work together to create a well-balanced and efficient line-following robot, with the L293D motor driver IC providing essential motor control capabilities.

## Usage üéÆ

1. Set up Turbo Fabi on a track with a visible line.
2. Power on Turbo Fabi.
3. Let Turbo Fabi calibrate its sensors.
4. Watch as Turbo Fabi autonomously follows the line.
